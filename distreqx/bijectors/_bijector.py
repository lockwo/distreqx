    """Differentiable bijection that knows to compute its Jacobian determinant.

    A bijector implements a differentiable and bijective transformation `f`, whose
    inverse is also differentiable (`f` is called a "diffeomorphism"). A bijector
    can be used to transform a continuous random variable `X` to a continuous
    random variable `Y = f(X)` in the context of `TransformedDistribution`.

    Typically, a bijector subclass will implement the following methods:

    - `forward_and_log_det(x)` (required)
    - `inverse_and_log_det(y)` (optional)

    The remaining methods are defined in terms of the above by default.

    Subclass requirements:

    - Subclasses must ensure that `f` is differentiable and bijective, and that
      their methods correctly implement `f^{-1}`, `J(f)` and `J(f^{-1})`. Distreqx
      will assume these properties hold, and will make no attempt to verify them.

        - `is_constant_jacobian`: Whether the Jacobian is promised to be constant

            False will be interpreted as "we don't know whether the Jacobian is
            constant", rather than "the Jacobian is definitely not constant". Only
            set to True if you're absolutely sure the Jacobian is constant; if

        - `is_constant_log_det`: Whether the Jacobian determinant is promised to be
            constant (which is the case for, e.g., volume-preserving bijectors). If
            None, it defaults to `is_constant_jacobian`. Note that the Jacobian
            determinant can be constant without the Jacobian itself being constant.
            Only set to True if you're absoltely sure the Jacobian determinant is
            constant; if you're not sure, set to False.
