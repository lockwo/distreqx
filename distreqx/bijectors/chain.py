    Bijectors are composable: if `f` and `g` are bijectors, then `g o f` is also
    a bijector. Given a sequence of bijectors `[f1, ..., fN]`, this class
    implements the bijector defined by `fN o ... o f1`.

    NOTE: the bijectors are applied in reverse order from the order they appear in
    the sequence. For example, consider the following code where `f` and `g` are
    two bijectors:

    ```python
    layers = []
    layers.append(f)
    layers.append(g)
    bijector = distrax.Chain(layers)
    y = bijector.forward(x)
    ```

    The above code will transform `x` by first applying `g`, then `f`, so that
    `y = f(g(x))`.
