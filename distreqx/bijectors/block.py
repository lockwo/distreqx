    """A wrapper that promotes a bijector to a block bijector.

    A block bijector applies a bijector to a k-dimensional array of events, but
    considers that array of events to be a single event. In practical terms, this
    means that the log det Jacobian will be summed over its last k dimensions.

    For example, consider a scalar bijector (such as `Tanh`) that operates on
    scalar events. We may want to apply this bijector identically to a 4D array of
    shape [N, H, W, C] representing a sequence of N images. Doing so naively with
    a `vmap` will produce a log det Jacobian of shape [N, H, W, C], because the
    scalar bijector will assume scalar events and so all 4 dimensions will be
    considered as batch. To promote the scalar bijector to a "block scalar" that
    operates on the 3D arrays can be done by `Block(bijector, ndims=3)`. Then,
    applying the block bijector will produce a log det Jacobian of shape [N]
    as desired.

    In general, suppose `bijector` operates on n-dimensional events. Then,
    `Block(bijector, k)` will promote `bijector` to a block bijector that
    operates on (k + n)-dimensional events, summing the log det Jacobian over its
    last k dimensions.
